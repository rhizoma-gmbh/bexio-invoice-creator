# Klog to Bexio

## Abstract

This tool currently does:

- format and sum equal equal descriptions to date ranges
- write invoice positions according to Radicles invoice requirements
- and then send it to the bexio API for the creation of a new invoice.

## Future

My intention is to convert this into a full-fledged bexio SDK, so other bexio users can use it to write their scripts against the API
